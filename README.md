# DoS DoS DoS DoS DoS
I built this lab as part of CodePathâ€™s CYB102 cybersecurity course to gain hands-on experience with Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and server-side mitigation. The goal was to simulate a Slowloris attack against an nginx web server and configure nginx with defensive rules to stop the attack. After completing this lab, I learned how to monitor real-time server traffic with nginx Amplify, deploy a Slowloris DoS attack, and configure nginx rules to mitigate DoS attacks.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM
- nginx (web server)
- Slowloris (DoS attack tool)
- nginx Amplify (cloud-based nginx monitoring platform)
- Wireshark (for analyzing .pcap network capture files)

## What This Lab Does
- Sets up nginx on a virtual machine and enables traffic monitoring through nginx Amplify.
- Simulates a Slowloris attack to flood the web server with slow, incomplete HTTP requests.
- Implements custom nginx configuration rules in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf to mitigate DoS attacks.
- Verifies mitigation effectiveness by monitoring connection counts before and after applying the defenses.
- Analyzes provided .pcap files to distinguish between a vulnerable server and a mitigated server.

### Wireshark analysis of vulnerable server (.pcap file comparison):

#### B.pcapng

#### Why is A.pcapng the vulnerable server?
I filtered by tcp.analysis.flags and saw many TCP RST packets where the server was actively closing slow or incomplete connections. This blocked the Slowloris attack. On the other hand, File B allowed the connections to remain open without closing them, showing it was the vulnerable server.
